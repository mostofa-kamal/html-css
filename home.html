         <center><b> Black money 0011 </b> </center><hr/>
        Black money includes all funds earned through illegal activity and otherwise legal income 
        that is not recoded for tex purposes. Black money proceeds are usually received in cash from 
        underground econimic activity and, as such, are not taxed. For example consider a poperty buyer 
        who purches land valued at 200,000. if the buyer only reports Tk 50,000 on the books and payes 
        Tk 150,000 The sellers in both examples have earned money from legal sourse but evaded taxes. 
        Furthermore, black money causes the financial health of a nation to be underestimated.
